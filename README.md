## Project Title
Emergency Response Scenario


## Objective

With 2 years of working experience in the sanatorium.

When the elder losing one's mind or being down on the ground, it is easy to be shock which make us forget what to do or how to do emergency treatment.

Moreover, there are numerous possible factors of black out such as cardiac infarction, orthostatic hypotension, stroke and hypoglycemia.

Therefore, I am planning to build application named "Emergency Response Scenario"


## Function

The content of the application consist with three parts.

Firstly, ask some questions to the user the condition of the patient to make a brief diagnosis to provide the actions to do.

Second, if user knows the name of a disease that patient was suffering from, they can search it from the list.

Lastly, this application gives some picture of the situation of the patient, to guess the problem of that person.
